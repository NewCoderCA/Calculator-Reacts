- Making a calculator app so anyone can use for quick Maths! :smiley:

## Installation and dependancies :computer: :paperclips: :rocket:

- `npm init -y` install or check version of `node -v`
- `npm install` and `npx create-react-app [app-name]` install React dependancies.
- `cd [app name]` go inside new project.
- `npm start` start creating quick Maths in development mode. :running_woman:
- Open `http://localhost:3000` to view it in your browser.
- Push first `commit -m "first commit"` to GitHub `git branch -M main`, `git remote add origin https://github.com/.....` and then `git push -u origin main`

## Cypress E2E Testing :white_check_mark:

- `cd /into/your/projectpath` and `ls` to list where you are.
- `npm install cypress --save-dev` Install Cypress locally as a dev dependancy for your project.
- `./node_modules/.bin/cypress open` Cypress will open in browser.
- Run `example` test to check it works.
- Create your test files in `cypress/integration` folder.
- Update package.json with Cypress:open command
- Ensure local host is running :running_man: then run cypress testing in browser.

## Deploy app using Heroku :rocket: :earth_africa:

- Sign up or login in `https://www.heroku.com`
- New, Create new app, Connect to GitHub as deployment method.
- Connect to GitHub and search for GitHub app, then connect.

#### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
